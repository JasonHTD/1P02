		<h1 class="header-one">My Hobbies</h1>
		<h4 class="header-three">I have many hobbies including video games, coding, listening to music, and animation/3d modelling.</h4>
		<h3 class="header-two">Video Games</h3>
		<p class="paragraph-one">I love playing video games because they're a great way to relax and they're a lot of fun.
			Some of the video games I play include Destiny 2, CS:GO, and Overwatch
		</p>
		<video id="vid" width="960" height="540" controls>
			<source src="../videos/destiny.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			The video failed to load, try another browser.

		<h3 class="header-two">Coding</h3>
		<p class="paragraph-one">I like coding because I like the idea of creating whatever I can imagine.
			<br>Coding allows me to create whatever I want, however I want.
			<br> The program I almost exclusively use to code is "<a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>"
			and I am glad I was able to use Atom in IASC 1P02. If I have to code in Java, IntelliJ is my IDE of choice.
		</p>
    <br>
		<h3 class="header-two">Music</h3>
		<p class="paragraph-one">When it comes to music I like a wide variety of EDM, Hip-Hop, and Rap. Recently I have been listening to a lot more EDM.<br>
			Here is one of the EDM songs I like called <a href="https://youtu.be/OUkkaqSNduU">You & Me</a>:
			<br> I suggest turning the volume on the slider down.
		</p>
		<audio class="picture-one" controls>

		</audio>
    <br>
		<h3 class="header-two">Animation/3D Modelling</h3>
		<p class="paragraph-one">I love 3d modelling and animation because it is another way to show my creativity by creating whatever I want. <br>The program
			I use to animate is called "<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/products/cinema-4d/overview/">Cinema 4D</a>". Sadly all of my C4D rendered videos are not
			in a format that HTML supports.
