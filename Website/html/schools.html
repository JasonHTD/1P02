			though Carberry Cougars ended up winning.

		<img class="picture-one" src="../images/Earnscliffe.jpg" alt="Earnscliffe Senior Public School" width="376" height="226">
		<p class="paragraph-two">Grade 6-8</p>
		<p class="paragraph-one">Throughout middle school I went to Earnscliffe Senior Public School. Earnscliffe was really fun and had a lot of extra-curricular activities.<br>
			Earnscliffe was where I learned to play the alto saxophone in band, which I was in thoughout my three years of middle school.
			One of my favourite extra-curricular activities was CYOB or Create Your Own Business where students had to make
			businesses and sell their products to other students as well as adults. <br>The school took a cut of the money you made, but if your product
			was good you would still profit.

		<br>
		<p class="paragraph-two">Grade 9-12</p>
		<p class="paragraph-one">For my four years of high school I attended Bramalea Secondary School. Though Bramalea had a lot to offer
			with tons of clubs and groups to choose from, the only club I joined was band, because I was busy with work at the time, as a swim instructor.
			I joined band to continue learning the alto saxophone along with some of my friends from middle school. My four years at Bramalea were what you
			would expect from a typical high school, and my favourite year was easily grade 12, where I got more free time due to spares.

			until I am done my major. So far I have not had any issues with Brock and look forward to a time when the campus will be open and
			classes are in person again.
